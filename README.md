ðŸ“Š Project: Customer Churn Prediction System 


ðŸ”¹ 1. Problem Statement

Businesses want to retain customers because acquiring new ones costs 5x more than retaining existing ones.
Weâ€™ll build a machine learning system to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) and help the business take preventive actions.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Dataset

Weâ€™ll use the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

Features: gender, tenure, monthly_charges, contract_type, payment_method, internet_service, etc.

Target: Binary Classification (Churn = Yes/No)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier

Version Control: GitHub



ðŸ”¹ 4. Project Workflow

âœ… Step 1: Data Collection & Understanding

âœ… Step 2: Data Preprocessing

âœ… Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

âœ… Step 4: Model Selection & Training

âœ… Step 5: Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)

âœ… Step 6: Model Tuning (Hyperparameter Optimization)

âœ… Step 7: Model Serialization (Pickle/Joblib)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Business Impact from this project

* Early identification of potential churners

* Enables targeted retention campaigns â†’ reduces revenue loss

* Improves customer lifetime value (CLV) and overall satisfaction

* Model can be integrated with dashboards for business analytics.
